# library-compare

## Concept

Basically, I want to explore the various:

1. Installation Processes
2. Setup Processes
3. Code Management (build, patterns, etc.)
4. Unit Testing
5. Code Execution

### Angular

#### Installation Processes

Installation is via the Angular CLI (ng) ...

```script
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

The CLI can be updated via `ng update` ...

```script
ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
```

#### Setup Processes

A new project is started with `ng new <project-name>`. There are various options provided (routing and/or CSS).

### React

### Vue

### Vanilla JavaScript
